I believe that if Person A is Anton, the money he demanded was to pay off debts he had. I knew he was in sady business, however I did not know the extent.
If this is true, I believe Anton was unable to pay off these debts and may have been murdered. From what I have heard from the FBI, this Person B has connections
with underground organizations. I believe that Person B was meant to jump out of the plane with Person A, but because Anton was unable to get the money he needed,
he jumped out of the plane to his death.

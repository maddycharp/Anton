## The Case of Person A

Person A, after boarding a flight with Person B, attempted to hijack the flight from Airport F to Airport P to Airport J. 
This flight experienced a connection flight to Airport P. One the second flight from Airport P to Airport J, according 
to flight records and witness accounts, Person A demanded the passengers to give a sum of $100,000. After passengers 
were able to collect a total $57,833, Person A ordered flight attendants to give him a parachute and it is believed he 
jumped out of the airstair at the back of the plane. According to flight patterns and records from attendants, it is 
believed that Person A jumped from the plane and would have landed somewhere near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Person A was 
never seen again, and we believe that Person B had connections and involvement in the hijacking and has been brought 
into custody.
